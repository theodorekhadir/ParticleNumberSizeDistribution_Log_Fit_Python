# dofit_python

This module is a Python adaptation of the particle number size distribution fitting module DOFIT develloped by Tareq Hussein in MATLAB, September 2006 
(http://www.borenv.net/BER/archive/pdfs/ber10/ber10-337.pdf).

The algorithm chooses the best number of modes based on overlapping modes and RMSE.

For now, it has been developped for <4modes only.
